    "For forecasting tasks, AutoML uses pre-processing and estimation steps that are specific to time-series. AutoML will undertake the following pre-processing steps:\n",
    "* Detect time-series sample frequency (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly) and create new records for absent time points to make the series regular. A regular time series has a well-defined frequency and has a value at every sample point in a contiguous time span \n",
    "* Impute missing values in the target (via forward-fill) and feature columns (using median column values) \n",
    "* Create grain-based features to enable fixed effects across different series\n",
    "* Create time-based features to assist in learning seasonal patterns\n",
    "* Encode categorical variables to numeric quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, AutoML will train a single, regression-type model across **all** time-series in a given training set. This allows the model to generalize across related series. If you're looking for training multiple models for different time-series, please check out the forecasting grouping notebook. \n",

    "The AutoMLConfig object defines the settings and data for an AutoML training job. Here, we set necessary inputs like the task type, the number of AutoML iterations to try, the training data, and cross-validation parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "For forecasting tasks, there are some additional parameters that can be set: the name of the column holding the date/time, the grain column names, and the maximum forecast horizon. A time column is required for forecasting, while the grain is optional. If a grain is not given, AutoML assumes that the whole dataset is a single time-series. We also pass a list of columns to drop prior to modeling. The _logQuantity_ column is completely correlated with the target quantity, so it must be removed to prevent a target leak.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecast horizon is given in units of the time-series frequency; for instance, the OJ series frequency is weekly, so a horizon of 20 means that a trained model will estimate sales up to 20 weeks beyond the latest date in the training data for each series. In this example, we set the maximum horizon to the number of samples per series in the test set (n_test_periods). Generally, the value of this parameter will be dictated by business needs. For example, a demand planning organizaion that needs to estimate the next month of sales would set the horizon accordingly. Please see the [energy_demand notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/forecasting-energy-demand) for more discussion of forecast horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a note about the cross-validation (CV) procedure for time-series data. AutoML uses out-of-sample error estimates to select a best pipeline/model, so it is important that the CV fold splitting is done correctly. Time-series can violate the basic statistical assumptions of the canonical K-Fold CV strategy, so AutoML implements a [rolling origin validation](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/) procedure to create CV folds for time-series data. To use this procedure, you just need to specify the desired number of CV folds in the AutoMLConfig object. It is also possible to bypass CV and use your own validation set by setting the *validation_data* parameter of AutoMLConfig.\n",
